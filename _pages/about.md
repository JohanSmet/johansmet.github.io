Greetings, I'm Johan Smet, a professional software developer from Belgium. I get a kick out of telling computers what to do, but I'm also an avid gamer, metal head and sci-fi nerd. And surely you can tell I'm not very good at writing "about me" pages.

This website shows some of my personal/hobby projects that might be useful to somebody out there.

Don't hesitate to send any constructive comments, remarks or questions my way via e-mail to [johan.smet@justcode.be](mailto:johan.smet@justcode.be).
