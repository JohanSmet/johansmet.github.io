## Summary
I'm a software developer with a passion for problem solving. My goal is to build solutions that make people's jobs easier, more efficient and/or more enjoyable. 

I enjoy the entire process of building software solutions but I am at my best with the more technical aspects. I like creating structure out of nothing or determining the minimal set of required changes to adapt a existing solution to meet new demands.
